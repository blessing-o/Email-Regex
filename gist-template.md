# Title (Email Regex)

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching within strings. In this tutorial, we'll dissect the regular expression used to match an email address and understand each component's role in defining this pattern.

## Summary

The regex /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/ validates email addresses. Let's break down each part of this expression to understand its function.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors define the start and end of a line in the regex pattern. In our email regex, ^ signifies the start of the line, ensuring the pattern starts from the beginning of the string.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify the quantity of characters or groups to match. In the email regex, {2,6} after [a-z\.] ensures the top-level domain contains 2 to 6 characters.

### Grouping Constructs
Parentheses () create groups within the regex pattern. In the email regex, ( ... ) groups the username, domain, and top-level domain separately.

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions define a set of characters to match. In the email regex, [a-z0-9_\.-] matches lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, dots, and hyphens in the username.

### Character Classes
Character classes represent a group of characters to match. In the email regex, [\da-z\.-] matches digits, lowercase letters, dots, and hyphens in the domain.


### The OR Operator
The OR operator | allows for alternatives in the regex pattern. In our email regex, it's used to match either a 6-character or 3-character top-level domain.

### Flags
Flags modify the behavior of the regex pattern matching. In our email regex, there are no flags used.

### Character Escapes
Backslashes \ are used to escape special characters in the regex pattern. In our email regex, they are used before ., @, and \.
